# Movies-ETL

For a Hackathon event, movie data was extracted from Wikipidia (in the form of a json file) and Kaggle (kaggle_metadata.csv & ratings.csv). This data was transformed by cleaning and merging and ultimately loaded on SQL platform for it to be used by the hacking event.

## Purpose of the project will include the following steps

  * **Create an ETL pipeline from raw data to a SQL database.**

  * **Extract data from disparate sources using Python.**

  * **Clean and transform data using Pandas.**

  * **Use regular expressions (Regex) to parse data and to transform text into numbers.**

  * **Load data with PostgreSQL and verify in PgAdmin.**
